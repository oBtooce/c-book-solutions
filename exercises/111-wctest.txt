Exercise 1-11: Testing the Word Count Program

There are many ways to test the word count program.  Some of these are as follows:
1) Inputting nothing
2) Inputting enough values such that the integer cap is overflowed (easiest to do this for character count)
3) Inputting characters that are not recognized by the standard ASCII character set
	-> this could mean Arabic, Cyrillic, kanji (and any other Asian alphabet), etc.
4) Inputting other types of whitespace, e.g. carriage returnsExercise 1-11: Testing the Word Count Program
